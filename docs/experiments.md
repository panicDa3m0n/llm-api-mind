# Experiments

This file tracks hypotheses, baselines, variants, scenarios, metrics, and results.

The project should not accept a cognitive module only because it feels intelligent. Each meaningful module should have a measurable experiment.

## EXP-0001 - Baseline Chat Trace

Status: implementation-ready

Hypothesis:

Before cognitive modules, full tracing alone improves development quality because failures become inspectable and reproducible.

Baseline:

MiniMax M2.7 chat call without memory, attention, reflection, goals, or background jobs.

Variant:

None for the first slice. This experiment establishes the measurement substrate.

Scenario:

Run local chat turns through the backend and inspect stored traces for messages, provider request/response metadata, latency, errors, and final assistant response.

Metrics:

- Turn trace exists for every chat request.
- Trace contains enough data to debug provider errors.
- Stored messages match the visible conversation.
- Latency and usage metadata are captured when available.
- No hidden state is required to understand the response.

Result:

Pending scenario run. Backend support now exists for persistent sessions, messages, turns, and traces.

Decision:

Do not proceed to memory and attention until baseline tracing is stable.

## EXP-0002 - Episodic Memory

Status: planned

Hypothesis:

An agent using the memory API retrieves prior project facts more accurately than a baseline agent using only limited conversation context.

Baseline:

MiniMax M2.7 with normal chat history and no memory API.

Variant:

MiniMax M2.7 with `mind_api` access to memory write/search.

Scenario:

Multi-session project conversation where later turns require recall of earlier preferences, decisions, and constraints.

Metrics:

- Correct recall rate.
- False recall rate.
- Useful memory retrieval rate.
- Unnecessary memory retrieval rate.
- Latency and token overhead.

Result:

Pending Phase 3.

Decision:

Pending.

## EXP-0003 - Attention Context Pack

Status: planned

Hypothesis:

An attention module that prepares a small context pack improves response relevance without flooding model context.

Baseline:

Memory search results inserted directly or no memory at all.

Variant:

`/mind/attention/context` selects and ranks memory, state, active goals, and recent events.

Scenario:

Project continuation tasks requiring only a small subset of prior context.

Metrics:

- Task success.
- Context precision.
- Context recall.
- Token overhead.
- Human-rated usefulness.

Result:

Pending Phase 3.

Decision:

Pending.
